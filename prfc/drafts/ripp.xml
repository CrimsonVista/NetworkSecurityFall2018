     <t>The Reliable Internetwork Playground Protocol (RIPP) defines
      the standards used to communicate between entities over the Playground
      network. It reliably establishes connections, transmits data with certain
      degree of error detection and correction and defines a graceful way of
      terminating the connection. It also communicates with the upper and lower
      layers using multiplexing and demultiplexing of data streams.</t>

   <section title="Introduction">
     <t>RFC's (Request for Comments) are a publication of the Internet 
     Engineering Task Force (IETF). RFC's have many purposes including
     the publication of standards, general information, and best
     practices.</t>
     
     <t>The PLAYGROUND experiment, developed by Seth James Nielson,
     is a pedigogical framework for instructing principles of Internet
     Security. The primary goal of the PLAYGROUND framework is to provide
     a network system that allows students and researchers to develop
     security mechanisms as well as attacks against them. The PLAYGROUND
     system is designed to provide a complex enough system to enable
     kinds of attacks and defenses one finds in the real Internet but
     with a much reduced complexity.</t>
     
     <t>Not only does PLAYGROUND provide a reduced complexity, but it
     also allows a student to think in terms of principles instead of
     just in raw implementation. Cross-site scripting attacks may
     disappear in the future, but the principles of colliding security
     spaces will not. PLAYGROUND allows the students to try out principles
     in a new environment and with new concrete instantiations.</t>
     
     <t>Standards and other publications, such as RFC's, are a critical
     part of the security process. Open standards allow design flaws
     to be captured early in the development of an Internet protocol
     or system. Discovered flaws can be reported and fixed quickly
     and effectively.</t>
     
     <t>Accordingly, as part of the PLAYGROUND experiment, collaborating
     participants, such as the students in a class, can practice and
     experiment with a publication process similar to RFC's. These publications
     are called Playground RFC's and follow the same formats and
     serve the same purposes insofar as possible.</t>
     
     <t>This memo describes the PRFC standards, largely pointing to the
     corresponding standards for RFCs. Differences, where they exist,
     are noted. Also included is a description of a modified xml2rfc tool
     that can help to produce PRFC's with the proper formatting.</t>

   <section title="Purpose/Technical Background">
    <t> In this document, we describe Reliable Internetwork Playground Protocol (R.I.P.P),
      a protocol which is used for communication over the Playground -
      a network system that allows students and researchers to develop
      security mechanisms as well as attacks against them - defined in 
      JHU Network Security class. </t>
   </section>

   <section title="Protocol Specifications">
   <section title="Session Establishment">
     <t>RIPP protocol consists of a unique Playground IP Address (PIP) which will uniquely 
     identify the machine connected to the Playground network. RIPP also has port identifiers
     built in to identify and handle multiplexing and demultiplexing which can handle multiple
     separate data streams.
    </t>

    <t>RIPP performs a "three-way handshake" which establishes the session between the communicating 
      entities which is followed by data transmission. Establishing a session is essential
      before any transmission of payload can occur. Similarly, no data can be transferred after 
      the session has been terminated. There is no restriction on who can establish a connection.
      It can be initiated by either party in the communication channel. Once an entity initiates
      the connection, the other party should respond with an acknowledgment. 
    </t>

    <t>A simple "three-way handshake" is shown in figure 1 below. 
      The figure shows 2 parties RIPP A and RIPP B performing the handshake.
      In this scenario, RIPP A initiates the connection and RIPP B is 
      responding to the handshake. RIPP A sends a SYN packet indicating that it will use 
      a certain sequence number. RIPP B send back a SYN and acknowledges the SYN it 
      received from RIPP A. The ACK sent by RIPP B states that it is expecting to hear sequence
      which follows the previous sequence number, acknowledging the earlier SYN.
      RIPP A responds with an empty ACK and then starts sending data from the next stage.

    </figure>
    </t>

    <t>The sequence number of the SYN packet can be based on any number generation system but 
       should be different for all the SYN packets sent out. No two connections should have
       the same sequence number.
    </t>
   </section>
   
   <section title="Data Transmission">
     <t>After the connection has been established, the sender and receiver can send packets
      of data to each other and continue communicating with each other. The way that 
      data flows between these two entities can be perceived as a stream oriented 
      transfer of data. The RIPP protocol sends chunks of bytes from the sender to the
      receiver. The RIPP protocol has a maximum payload size (Data) of 1500 bytes. In case the
      payload is greater than 1500, the RIPP protocol should break it down into chunks of 
      1500 bytes.</t>

      <t>On the client side, the SeqNo Number header field for the first data packet
       sent is set equal to the SeqNo number of the (SYN-ACK) ACK packet sent during the RIPP handshake.
       For subsequent data packets, the SeqNop number is determined by adding
       the sequence number of the previous packet with the length of the 
       previous packet. On the server side, the first data packet sent has
       the sequence number of the SYN-ACK packet sent during the handshake.
       And similarly, for the subsequent packets, the sequence number is
       determined by adding the sequence number and length of the previous packet.
      </t>
      
      <t>All transmitted bytes MUST be acknowledged while both parties are in
      the ESTABLISHED state. However, each individual packet does not have to be
      acknowledged. Rather, when an ACK is sent, it indicates ALL of the bytes
      that have been received thus far. Transmitting protocols MAY transmit more
      than one packet at a time; the protocol need not wait for an ACK before
      sending another packet. The packets currently awaiting ACK are known as
      the transmission window. Packets in the transmission window are resent
      until acknowledged by an appropriate ACK packet. When an Packet is received,
      all packets within the transmission window with SeqNo + data length less
      than the AckNo can be removed from the window.
      </t>
      
      <t>In the example transmission below, multiple data transmissions are
      sent on both sides before ACKs are sent back.</t>

   <section title="Session Termination">
     <t>The RIPP protocol specific a set of exchanges required to gracefully shut down the 
      connection between communicating entities. A simple handshake process is used
      for correctly terminating the connection. The first step for terminating the connection
      is to send a FIN packet to the other client. There is no restriction on who can 
      initiate the FIN request; any one of the communicating parties can send it to the 
      other one. Once a FIN packet is sent, the protocol enters a closing state in which
      no further data packets can be transmitted and no
      further data packets received will be acknowledged or processed. However, it should
      continue to re-transmit unacknowledged data packets and an unacknowledged FIN packet.
      </t>
      
      <t>Once the other party receives the FIN request, it MUST process it in order. That is,
      if there are any received data packets not yet processed (e.g., because they have
      been received out of order), they must be processed first before processing the FIN.
      This may mean waiting for the other party to retransmit.
      </t>
      
      <t>Once the FIN packet is processed in-order, the RIPP protocol MUST transmit a final
      ACK packet, acknowledging the FIN, and then enter a CLOSED state. In the CLOSED state,
      it SHOULD not process any additional packets.
    </t>
    
    <t>It is possible for both sides to transmit a FIN at approximately the same time.
      If either side receives a FIN after transmitting a FIN, it need not wait for a 
      ACK. The FIN indicates that the other side has already shut down and no further
      ACKS are expected.
      </t>

      <t>One side sending to terminate the connection
        is shown below in figure 2a. This figure includes
        a retransmission of SeqNo 1501 (i.e., this packet
        was lost or corrupted) to illustrate that the final
        ACK is not sent until after all other data has been processed.

    </t>
    
    <t>It should be clear from this example that the RIPP protocol's
    guarantee for reliable delivery is not enforced after the peer
    transmits a FIN. The FIN indicates that the other side is not
    processing data packets anymore, so it does no good to attempt
    to reliably deliver them. Accordingly, application layer protocols
    SHOULD communicate shutdown information to each other to ensure
    a clean shutdown. FIN SHOULD NOT be relied upon for the graceful
    shutdown; it is a best effort attempt to do so.
    </t>
   </section>

   

   <section title="Error Handling">
     <t>There are many different classes of errors. The most difficult type
     is that of unexpected packet types. If unexpected packets are ignored,
     that may make the connection more resilient, but it also makes it more likely
     that a restarted connection cannot be detected. For the purposes of this
     protocol, we err on the side of detecting restarts. Thus, incorrect packet
     types SHOULD cause a shutdown.
     </t>
     
     <t>For example, during the handshake, the server expects a SYN packet. If 
     any other packet type is received, the server SHOULD shutdown. Similarly,
     if a DATA packet is expected, a SYN SHOULD also cause an abort.</t>
     
     <t>Data transmission errors, on the other hand, are recoverable using 
     the acknowledgement and retransmisson discussed previously.</t>
     
     <t>Data transmission errors include:
      <list style="numbers">
        <t>Incorrect order of the packets</t>
        <t>Loss of packets</t>
        <t>Corrupt data inside the packet</t>
        <t>Phantom packets (receiver gets packets that have never been sent)</t>
       </list> 
       <list style="letters">
        <t>RIPP takes a simple approach to solving all these scenarios. In the scenario 
       where there is a loss of packets during handshake transmission or connection
       establishment, the corresponding party should resend the previous packet with
       a delay by keeping a timer.</t>
       <t>
        Both the communicating parties maintain a protocol buffer at their end - a sort of
        cache which temporarily stores data and waits for the missing packet and out
        of order data. As a result, RIPP can gracefully handle out of order packets and
        missing packets by storing them in the buffer before sending to the upper layers
        and sending ACK messages to the sender indicating retransmission which the 
        sender can resend. The sender also maintains a window on its side with the 
        timestamp when it was sent. If it does not receive an ACK before the timer expiry,
        it automatically resends the packet. 
      </t>
      <t>RIPP protocol also has a provision for correcting corrupt header as well as data inside the packet.
        A checksum field inside the RIPP header provides basic integrity of the message.
        RIPP uses the checksum to detect corruption of packet headers. i.e. the source, destination,
        and other meta-data.
        It also includes an extra checksum that protects the packet "payload" as well as the header.
        In case of simple scenarios this checksum can just be a simple one's complement or other
        fast and simple hash functions. The sender computes the hash and appends it in the 
        header as well as the data sent to the receiver. The receiver verifies it and in case
        of mismatch in the checksum, simply drops the packet and waits for retransmission.

      <t>In the scenario where duplicate data is received during retransmission, judged by
        SEQ number of the packet, the receiver simply discards them. In the case where
        phantom packets (unknown or radically different SEQ numbers) are received,
        the receiver simply discards them according to the RIPP protocol.

   ("Type", STRING), #values: "SYN", "ACK", "FIN"

    <t>The Type field technically can contain any combination of
    "SYN", "ACK", "DATA", and "FIN". However, for the current protocol definition,
    almost all legal values for Type are not combinations. Currently,
    the only legal combination is "SYN" and "ACK" for the SYN-ACK 
    packets described in the handshake section. Any other combinations
    are currently illegal and SHOULD result in an abort.

   <section title="Computational Algorithms">
     <t>The Procedures for calculating the checksum are as follows:
        <list style="numbers">
		<t>Make sure all fields other than CRC are set.</t>
		<t>Serialize the packet.</t>
		<t>Apply sha256 algorithm to the packet from 2.</t>
		<t>Take the packet from 1, attach byte result from 3 as CRC to packet.</t>

   <section title="State Machines">
     <t>A connection progresses through a series of states during its
  lifetime.  The states are:  LISTEN, SYN-SENT, SYN-RECEIVED,
  ESTABLISHED, FIN-WAIT-1, FIN-WAIT-2, CLOSE-WAIT, CLOSING, LAST-ACK,
  TIME-WAIT, and the fictional state CLOSED.  CLOSED is fictional
  because it represents the state when there is no TCB, and therefore,
  no connection.  Briefly the meanings of the states are:
  <list style="letters">
    <t>LISTEN - represents waiting for a connection request from any remote
    TCP and port.</t>
    <t>SYN-SENT - represents waiting for a matching connection request
    after having sent a connection request.</t>
    <t>SYN-RECEIVED - represents waiting for a confirming connection
    request acknowledgment after having both received and sent a
    connection request.</t>

    <t>ESTABLISHED - represents an open connection, data received can be
    delivered to the user.  The normal state for the data transfer phase
    of the connection.</t>

    <t>FIN-WAIT-1 - represents waiting for a connection termination request
    from the remote TCP, or an acknowledgment of the connection
    termination request previously sent.</t>

    <t>FIN-WAIT-2 - represents waiting for a connection termination request
    from the remote TCP.</t>

    <t>CLOSE-WAIT - represents waiting for a connection termination request
    from the local user.</t>

    <t>CLOSING - represents waiting for a connection termination request
    acknowledgment from the remote TCP.</t>

    <t>LAST-ACK - represents waiting for an acknowledgment of the
    connection termination request previously sent to the remote TCP
    (which includes an acknowledgment of its connection termination
    request).</t>

    <t>TIME-WAIT - represents waiting for enough time to pass to be sure
    the remote TCP received the acknowledgment of its connection
    termination request.</t>

    <t>CLOSED - represents no connection state at all.</t>
  </list>

   <!-- References split into informative and normative -->

   <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
    1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
    2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
       (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

    Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
    If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
    directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
    with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
    filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->

   <!-- Change Log

v00 2006-03-15  EBD   Initial version

v01 2006-04-03  EBD   Moved PI location back to position 1 -
                     v3.1 of XMLmind is better with them at this location.
v02 2007-03-07  AH    removed extraneous nested_list attribute,
                     other minor corrections
v03 2007-03-09  EBD   Added comments on null IANA sections and fixed heading capitalization.
                     Modified comments around figure to reflect non-implementation of
                     figure indent control.  Put in reference using anchor="DOMINATION".
                     Fixed up the date specification comments to reflect current truth.
v04 2007-03-09 AH     Major changes: shortened discussion of PIs,
                     added discussion of rfc include.
v05 2007-03-10 EBD    Added preamble to C program example to tell about ABNF and alternative 
                     images. Removed meta-characters from comments (causes problems).

v06 2010-04-01 TT     Changed ipr attribute values to latest ones. Changed date to
                     year only, to be consistent with the comments. Updated the 
                     IANA guidelines reference from the I-D to the finished RFC.
